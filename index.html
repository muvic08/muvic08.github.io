                    Chepnet.org is a community-based, not for profit organization based in Bomet and Narok counties, Kenya. As technology advances each new day there is need to update the rural community too in which women and girls are majority here in Kenya and need to ensure that girls are part of the people making the innovations of the 21st century, getting women into technology and generally STEM is good, for their growth in all dimensions. Our aim is to advance rural women in this new era of technology and to invite and inspire more girls to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), which are still male dominated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two major gaps that we are trying to fill, first that STEM is male dominated, which is a problem worldwide and secondly we work in rural, disadvantaged and underserved community.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Women in rural areas face a lot of challenges including; illiteracy, lack of business expertise, lack of facilities to train from and technology can solve many of this challenges. We only work with women since they are the ones who drive change in the communities, they are the ones who know first hand problems and with potential given to them they can develop innovative solutions to this problems yet the society has sidelined them, also there is notably increasing tech positions emerging in Africa and will require skilled workers, and so we are working to make women part of the generation coming. There is also need for more mentoring for girls in schools to get inspired about this fields, and thus we are working to have it done through creation of a pool of professional women in STEM.Chepnet is aiming to enhance womenâ€™s quality of life through enabling them use technology to learn how to do things.

                <p>
                    Technology enables them to stay in touch with the current affairs, it socially enrich their lives, help them keep in touch with family, for entertainment, climatic changes, learn child health care and thus this will improve their livelihoods just to name but a few benefits of being able to be connected. We aim extend support, community services, technology and innovation space beyond the city and to the villages to aid social, economic, political, and technological development.
